This folder includes multiple Python scripts that I have been working with in preparation of a computer vision project.

For the goal of this project, we aim to develop an AI model that can help us detect "blighted" elements from street-level images (e.g., broken windows/doors, boarded-up windows/doors, mismatched wall pieces, overgrown trees/lawns, etc). This model will be used alongside the responses of our survey work. We care about the elements at the very fine-grained level as we wonder how these environmental elements impact residents' safety perception.
