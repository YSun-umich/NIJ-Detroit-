# NIJ-Detroit
This project is sponsored by the National Institute of Justice and aims to measure Detroit residents' safety perception by integrating contextual data as well as spatial data into survey data. 

# What's in this folder
This folder includes multiple Python scripts that I have been working with in preparation of a computer vision project.

For the goal of this CV project, we aim to develop an AI model that can help us detect "blighted" elements from street-level images (e.g., broken windows/doors, boarded-up windows/doors, mismatched wall pieces, overgrown trees/lawns, etc). This model will be used alongside the collected responses of our survey. We care about the elements at the very fine-grained level ebcause we wonder how these environmental elements impact residents' safety perception. 

# CV project in the making
We made a field trip to Detroit this summer and have collected 1,000+ pictures. We are now developing our coding scheme. We will use the coding scheme for annotating the pictures, and will use Roboflow for initial model training phase. 

09.28.Roboflow Prep.ipynb, includes our specific coding scheme composition and potential next steps.
